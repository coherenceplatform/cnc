# CNC Flavors

A flavor is a set of IaC, build scripts, and deploy scripts, that work together to create a working environment. `cnc` has included flavors. As discussed in [customization](../customization/README.md) you can also customize (in part or whole) these further in your own repo.

## Included Flavors

`run-lite` is the fastest and cheapest flavor to get started with. It is designed to be as low cost as possible and will often fall under "free forever" pricing from GCP.

# install pipx
[pipx installation instructions](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation)

e.g. for macOS
```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

# install poetry
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

e.g.
```bash
pipx install poetry
```

# install dev dependencies
```bash
poetry install --with dev
```
Poetry will also install a script so the cli
can be run using `cnc` as if there was a binary installed.


# start a shell in the python virtual env
```bash
# starts a login shell in the virtual env created by poetry
# pre-requisite for the following commands (python shell, cli, etc.)
poetry shell
```

# running the tests
Run this in the `src` dir after running `poetry shell` as per above.

```bash
pytest
```

You can also run something like this to run one class (no need to qualify with path):
```pytest -k EnvironmentCollectionExistingDBTestCase -v```

# start an interactive python shell (ipython)
You can do this from anywhere once you have activated poetry shell

```bash
cnc shell start
```
e.g.:
- start in your `cnc` repo
- `poetry shell`
- `cd ../MY_SITE_DIR`
- `cnc shell start`


# running the cli
```bash
cnc --help
```

# dependencies

## Python

(check yours with `python --version`)

There's a codespace set up in the repo where you just run `poetry shell` and you're all set to work, that's the easiest place to be.
